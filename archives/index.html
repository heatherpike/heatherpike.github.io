        <p>Hello World! I am about to embark on a journey to change careers. I am My desire to become a developer boils down to my yearning to create things and use my brainpower to the fullest!  </p>
<p>I was always naturally gifted in math and problem solving as a child, but I was also talented with English and writing - being a girly girl with no techie disposition, I ended up going down the MARCOMM path - I have long regretted it because I think I would have excelled more in math or tech. I took a CS101 course and a web design course in college and I really enjoyed and excelled at both, but I can’t tell you why I never pursued those topics further - could have been senioritis, as I think I took those my last year of college and I was probably ready to just get out there into the real world. </p>
<p>Now, years later, I have built a career in digital and brand marketing and earned my MBA in 2008. It’s been an exciting career and I have learned a lot over the years, but I’ve always had this nagging feeling like I missed my calling. </p>
<p>I yearn to create things and put my critical thinking skills to use. My personality sits the fence between introversion and extroversion but I lean more toward the introverted side; my current career forces me to flex my extroverted side and go outside my comfort zone, which is good experience but has been exhausting! </p>
<p>For some reason I always thought I should push myself to develop those areas in which I was not strongest; however, a book I read through work a couple years ago, Strengths Finder, opened me up to the opposite perspective. This book encourages individuals to nurture their strengths rather than work on their weaknesses. After reading this book I have felt more and more like I am not in the right career because I know I would excel so much more if I were doing something that leveraged my natural problem solving and mathematical talents.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about going back to school to learn to code for a long time but didn’t think it would be feasible until I heard about the bootcamp option. About 5-6 years ago, before bootcamps like Fullstack Academy existed, I visited a university to find out what it would take to get a second bachelor’s in computer science. I was told it would take 3 years. That discouraged me, and at the time I was still pretty green in my marketing career and enjoying the early phases of it, so I decided to continue on that path at the time. However, the thought that I was meant for something else continued to linger in the back of my mind. </p>
<p>I work in the education industry, and someone in my current company posted a link to an article about a programming bootcamp a little over a year ago. My heart soared when I realized it was exactly what I needed! </p>
<p>I recently moved to NYC, just down the street from Fullstack, and I finally decided to make my time here count by enrolling in the January 2015 cohort. In preparation for bootcamp, I am spending the next 4 weeks flooding my brain with the basics of Javascript, git, node.js, and the like while trying to improve my command of the command line as I learn to navigate the terminal on my shiny new Macbook Air. </p>
<p>It’s a crazy time as I stuff my brain full of new knowledge while wrapping things up at my marketing job. I am so excited to start the immersive bootcamp experience on Jan. 12 and be on my way to becoming a pro dev! </p>
